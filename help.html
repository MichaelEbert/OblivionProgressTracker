    <i>You can click the </i>üõà<i> at the top left corner of this info box to get back to this page again.</i></p>

    <p>This is the info box, which can display maps, images, and wiki articles to inform you of any glitches, NPCs, quests, etc. that you are unfamiliar with. This route is designed so that anyone with a basic understanding of the game can learn all of the skills they need as they go!</p> 
    <p>Before attempting 100% Completion, you should become familiar with a few things first:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <a href="https://prclive.run/wiki/Oblivion:Overview#Requirements">Requirements</a> for what counts as 100% Completion.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The <a href="https://prclive.run/wiki/Oblivion:Overview#Rules_for_Speedrunning">Rules</a> for what counts as a valid and verifiable run if you are a speedrunner.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>How to navigate and use the feautres of the interactive guide.</li>

    <ul>
        <li><span class="npc">NPCs</span></li> are all of the characters you will interact with. If you are having trouble finding them, click the ‚ùî next to their name to see what they look like and any bugs related to their schedule.
        <li><span class="quest"><b>Quests</b></span></li> tend to have many bugs that can randomly interfere with route instructions. Click the ‚ùî next to the quest name for a list of bugs and their workarounds.
        <li><span class="nirnroot">Nirnroot</span></li>
        <li><span class="spellname">Spells</span> include standard spells, as well as custom player-made spells, which will be indicated by an underscore: <span class="spellname">_CustomSpell</span></li>
    </ul>

    Try clicking on any ‚ùî icon in the guide content to the left to see an article about that term.
    In addition, any glitches and tech mentioned in the run can be clicked to learn how to perform them.

    Having a co-pilot to help read you instructions and check off objectives as you go can be helpful, but you can check objectives off yourself easily if you are going through the route at your own pace.
