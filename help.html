    <p><b>Welcome to the Oblivion 100% Interactive Guide!</b></p>

    <i>You can click the </i>üõà<i> at the top left corner of this info box to get back to this page again.</i></p>

    <p>This is the info box, which can display maps, images, and wiki articles to inform you of any glitches, NPCs, quests, etc. that you are unfamiliar with. This route is designed so that anyone with a basic understanding of the game can learn all of the skills they need as they go!</p> 
    <p>Before attempting 100% Completion, you should become familiar with a few things first:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <a href="https://prclive.run/wiki/Oblivion:Overview#Requirements">Requirements</a> for what counts as 100% Completion.</li>
        <li>The <a href="https://prclive.run/wiki/Oblivion:Overview#Rules_for_Speedrunning">Rules</a> for what counts as a valid and verifiable run if you are a speedrunner.</li>
        <li>The Checklist, Guide, and Map, which can be navigated to at the top of the webpage.</li>
        <li>How to use this info box.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can see your total progress at the top right of the webpage. You can click/drag the bottom right of this info box to resize it.</p>
    <p><b>You need to fill out the following info as you go:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each term with a checkbox needs to be clicked. Alternatively, you can drag your save file onto the Checklist page to auto import your progress periodically.</li>
        <li>You will need to use several Save Files repeatedly throughout the run. Make a note of the number for each save file as they appear and that number will be shown to you again later when you need it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>There are several formatted elements that bring up info in this box:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="npc">NPCs</span> are all of the characters you will interact with. If you are having trouble finding them, click the ‚ùî next to their name to see what they look like and any bugs related to their schedule.</li>
        <li><span class="quest"><b>Quests</b></span> tend to have many bugs that can randomly interfere with route instructions. Click the ‚ùî next to the quest name for a list of bugs and their workarounds.</li>
        <li><span class="nirnroot">Nirnroot</span> and <b>Places</b> have a üó∫Ô∏è icon you can click to see their location on the map.</li>
        <li><span class="book"><b>Skill Books</b></span> and other <i>Notes</i> and <i>Books</i> are italicized. Click the ‚ùî next to a Skill Book to get more info about it.</li>
        <li><b>Misc.</b> objectives such as <b>Locations</b>, <b>Horses</b>, etc. will all be bold but not colorful. Some of them have üó∫Ô∏è or ‚ùî icons.</li>
        <li><a>Glitches</a> can also be clicked for an article explaining how to perform them in further detail. For example, learn how to <a href="https://prclive.run/wiki/Oblivion:Save_Clipping">Save Clip</a>!</li>
        <li>Some instructions, such as Save Clips, include a üì∑ icon that can bring up an in-game screenshot of what the instruction is describing.</li>
        <li>The üìÑ icon at the top left brings up the Table of Contents for the guide, and the üó∫Ô∏è icon brings up an Interactive Map!</li>
        <li>Every image in this guide can also be clicked to view it larger in the info box.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>There are a few additional formatted terms, which are not interactable:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="spellname">Spells</span> include standard spells, as well as custom player-made spells, which will be indicated by an underscore, such as <span class="spellname">_CustomSpell</span>.</li>
        <li>A few <code>Console Commands</code> are needed to verify the run.</li>
        <li>Sometimes you will be instructed to press specific buttons, such as hotkey <kbd>3</kbd> or <kbd>Alt + Tab</kbd>.</li>
