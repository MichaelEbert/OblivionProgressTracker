<h1>Oblivion Glitch Reference Guide</h1>
<h3>Made by Ben Songster (MeemawHustlin)</h3>
<p>This document is designed to give you a quick reference of how to perform several glitches that may be useful throughout the 100% completion challenge. None of these are required to get 100% completion. Bolded ones are highly recommended to save you a lot of time for minimal effort.</p>

<div id="permakey" class="section">
	<div class="sectionTitle">Perma Key</div>
	<div class="collapsibleContent">
		<div class="subtitle">Effect:</div>
		<div>Your character will be able to open most locked doors, even if they require a key, without having to pick the lock or acquire the key.</div>
		<div class="subtitle">How to:</div>
		<ol>
			<li>Load your <span class="replaceable" clid="save_permakey">PermaKey_Save</span>. This is a save by the door in the tutorial with the dead goblin.</li>
			<li>Quicksave and open the door. A popup should appear confirming you opened it with the Iron Key.</li>
			<li>Without closing the popup, press escape and load the quicksave you made.</li>
			<li>Now most doors will open without needing to pick them or find the key.</li>
		</ol>
		<div class="subtitle">Additional Notes:</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Certain doors, particularly scripted doors, may not open even if this glitch is active.</li>
			<li>This glitch is persistent across all save files/characters, and only stops working if the entire game is closed.</li>
		</ul>

<div id="boostjump" class="section">
	<div class="sectionTitle">Boost Jump</div>
	<div class="collapsibleContent">
		<div class="subtitle">Effect:</div> 
		<div>Your character will gain momentum off a slope and jump significantly higher than usual.</div>
		<div class="subtitle">How to:</div>
		<ol>
			<li> Find a surface, such as stairs, the base of a pillar, or a surface with a sudden change in height.</li>
			<li> Run at the surface and jump as you are being “pushed” up in height from it. For example, if it is a staircase, you will want to jump as the step “pushes” you upward to the next step height.</li>
			<li> When timed correctly, you will retain the “pushed” upward momentum of the surface as you leave the ground, allowing your jump height to be extremely high.</li>
		</ol>
		<div class="subtitle">Additional Notes:</div>
		<ul>
			<li> Boost jumping works the most often when boosting off the last step of a staircase.</li>
			<li> The timing takes practice, but the glitch becomes easier the faster your character’s speed is.</li>
			<li> You can additionally try jumping into a surface and jump again as you hit it to try and get a minor boost to your jump height. This is mostly useful with pillar bases.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>

<div id="duping" class="section">
	<div class="sectionTitle">Dupe/Duping</div>
	<div class="collapsibleContent">
		<div class="subtitle">Effect:</div> 
		<div>An item in your inventory is duplicated into several copies of itself when dropped.</div>
		<div class="subtitle">How to:</div>
		<ol>
			<li>Select a scroll stack that has at least 2 of the same scroll from your inventory.</li>
			<li>Without exiting the inventory, drop an item you want to dupe that is in a smaller stack than the scroll stack you selected.</li>
			<li>Exit the inventory and the chosen item will be dropped in a stack the size of the scroll stack.</li>
		</ol>
		<div class="subtitle">Additional Notes:</div>
		<ul>
			<li>If you accidentally select a few different scroll stacks in a row, you may have to exit and open your inventory and try the glitch again.</li>
			<li>It is faster and less laggy to dupe a stack of an item rather than a single item when duping up to a large quantity. Try duping a single item with a smaller scroll stack first, and then dupe that larger stack of that item again with a larger scroll stack. Duping a single item with a 200+ scroll stack may crash the game.</li>
		</ul>

<div id="qsqldeaggro" class="section">
	<div class="sectionTitle">QSQL De-Aggro</div>
	<div class="collapsibleContent">
		<div class="subtitle">Effect:</div> 
		<div>Hostile enemies from a dungeon you have just exited will despawn and are no longer aggro, allowing you to fast travel away without fighting them.</div>
		<div class="subtitle">How to:</div>
		<ol>
			<li>Exit the dungeon with hostile enemies in it.</li>
			<li>Immediately quick save and quick load.</li>
			<li>The enemies will have a chance of despawning and no longer being aggro.</li>
			<li>Fast travel to where you need to go.</li>
		</ol>
		<div class="subtitle">Additional Notes:</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Stands for “Quick Save Quick Load De-Aggro.”</li>
			<li>This glitch is slightly luck dependent. There is no guarantee that it will work.</li>
			<li>This glitch will only be useful if there are no enemies outside of the dungeon preventing you from fast travelling anyway.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>

<div id="saveclip" class="section">
	<div class="sectionTitle">Save Clip</div>
	<div class="collapsibleContent">
		<div class="subtitle">Effect:</div> 
		<div>Your character runs into a wall and walks through it.</div>
		<div class="subtitle">How to:</div>
		<ol>
			<li>Run into a wall, and quicksave while still running into it. Try to have as perpendicular of an angle to the wall as possible.</li>
			<li>Exit to the main menu of the game via the Escape Key menu or enter a new area of the game.</li>
			<li>Load your quick save and hold running forward while the screen is loading.</li>
			<li>Your character will usually end up running straight through the wall, allowing you to move out of bounds.</li>
		</ol>
		<div class="subtitle">Additional Notes:</div>
		<ul>
			<li>This glitch is partially luck dependent. Not all walls can be clipped through as easily as another.</li>
			<li>Flatter walls tend to work better.</li>
		</ul>
		<div>For additional info and to see the glitch performed, refer to our <a href="https://youtu.be/qtgGttAuMfs">Save Clip Tutorial Video.</a> </div>

<div id="voidwarp" class="section">
	<div class="sectionTitle">Void Warp</div>
	<div class="collapsibleContent">
		<div class="subtitle">Effect:</div> 
		<div>Your character returns from being out of bounds by falling to the bottom of the world.</div>
		<div class="subtitle">How to:</div>
		<ol>
			<li>Out of bounds areas usually do not have anything preventing you from falling below the actual constructed area of the map. Find a way to fall past everything.</li>
			<li>As you are falling, look up and center yourself below where you want to be teleported to.</li>
			<li>When you hit the bottom limit of the world, the game will teleport you to the nearest in-bounds area of the game, which is usually directly above where you are.</li>
		</ol>
		<div class="subtitle">Additional Notes:</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Where you get warped to exactly can vary on several factors. Refer to the specific instructions in the main guide for where you should position yourself in those situations.</li>
		</ul>

<div id="yieldglitch" class="section">
	<div class="sectionTitle">Yield Glitch/Instant Yield Glitch</div>
	<div class="collapsibleContent">
		<div class="subtitle">Effect:</div>
		<div>Hostile guards will stop pursuing you despite having a bounty, allowing you to fast travel and avoid being arrested until you talk to a guard again.</div>
		<div class="subtitle">How to (Method 1: Yield Glitch):</div>
		<ol>
			<li>Drag hostile guards towards a doorway to an outdoor area.</li>
			<li>Yield by holding block while trying to talk to a guard. You need to be spaced far enough away that the guard will not immediately enter dialogue with you. Alternatively, if they get staggered by block knockback, the window of timing will be much easier.</li>
			<li>Immediately exit the area before the guard can talk to you. Do not re-enter the area or you will be arrested again. Guards in other areas will now not pursue you.</li>
		</ol>
		<div class="subtitle">How to (Method 2: Instant Yield Glitch)</div>
		<ol>
			<li>Drag hostile guards to any outdoor location.</li>
			<li>Yield by holding block while trying to talk to a guard, and press Tab to open your inventory on the same frame.</li>
			<li>When done correctly, the “[City] Guard accepts your yield” message will appear at the top left of the screen, and you will be able to fast travel to pay off your bounty.</li>
		</ol>
		<div class="subtitle">Additional Notes:</div>
		<ul>
			<li>The Instant Yield Glitch has inconsistent side effects, including being unable to wait because guards are approaching. If this happens, you will want to load an earlier save, as guards will always be approaching since they are running all the way from where you fast travelled away from to where you are now.</li>
			<li>If you pay off your fines and bounty with a Thieves Guild Doyen after performing this glitch, hostile guards may remain aggressive despite no longer having a bounty. Make sure you yield to these guards before they hurt you or random NPCs may die trying to defend you.</li>
		</ul>

<div id="eightpotionglitch" class="section">
	<div class="sectionTitle">8 Potion Glitch</div>
	<div class="collapsibleContent">
		<div class="subtitle">Effect:</div>
		<div>Allows you to consume 8 potions instead of the normal 4.</div>
		<div class="subtitle">How To(Method 1, Hotkeys):</div>
		<ol>
			<li>Hotkey the desired potion.</li>
			<li>Use the hotkey to drink the potion four times.</li>
			<li>Open your inventory and drink four more of the potion for a total of eight.</li>
			<li>You now have double the intended stacked effects of the potion.</li>
		</ol>
		<div class="subtitle">How To(Method 2, no Hotkeys):</div>
		<ol>
			<li>Drink four potions from your inventory.</li>
			<li>Exit and re-enter your inventory screen.</li>
			<li>Drink four more potions from your inventory.</li>
		</ol>
		<div class="subtitle">Additonal Notes:</div>
		<ul>
			<li>This glitch only works on potions with a drain effect (I.E. Skooma, alcoholic drinks).</li>
		</ul>
