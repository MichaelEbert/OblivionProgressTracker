<h1>Oblivion 100% Completion Challenge</h1>
<h3>Made by Ben Songster (MeemawHustlin)</h3>
This guide is intended for casual players to go about achieving the 100% objectives at their own pace. If you prefer to follow an explicit and linear set of instructions, refer to the speedrunner version of this guide and the other materials. This guide is organized by objective, focusing mainly on explaining the possible ways the 100% objectives could become impossible to achieve, and how to avoid those softlocks. Occasionally extra advice is given for ways to speed up the process of achieving certain objectives, but no glitches/exploits are absolutely required in any case. 
This guide also functions as a way to visually see all of the information that the speedrun route logic is developed around for those who are curious about that.
Each section includes general tips, along with specific softlocks that will make certain objectives impossible.

<div class="section" id="questscompleted">
<div class="sectionTitle">208 Quests Completed</div>
<div class="collapsibleContent">
Quests Completed requires you to finish each quest in a way that will move it to the completed section of your quest journal.
Tips:
<ul>
<li>This section of the guide will contain the majority of the info you will need for getting 100% completion. This is because the vast majority of other objectives tend to be tied to quests in various ways:
<ul>
<li>Some free skill boosts are able to be acquired by finishing quests in certain ways.</li>
<li>Three Oblivion Gates Shut are acquired during the Main Quest.</li>
<li>Several merchants that are part of the Stores Invested In accomplishment are encountered through quests.</li>
<li>All 15 Artifacts Found are acquired during the <a href="index.html#questDaedric_Shrines">Daedric Shrine Quests</a>.</li>
<li>Many Skill Books are in convenient locations you already have to visit during quests, and some are actually impossible to acquire later if you do not get them during certain quests.</li>
<li>A few quests cause softlocks with the Places Found objective, most notably during the Fighters Guild and Main Quest.</li>
<li>The majority of the Fame objective is directly dependent on how you finish certain quests.</li>
<li>Many Nirnroots Found are in convenient locations during certain quests.</li>
<li>The Max Faction Ranks are awarded when specific quests are completed.</li>
<li>To get the Quest Journal Filled objective, a few additional quests need to be done in certain ways, and in a certain order.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
This section will break down each quest and the specific other objectives and potential softlocks to consider while doing it. For a summary of the tips and softlocks specific to a single accomplishment, refer to the other sections of this guide.
<ul>
<li>All quests are listed, so quests that do not have additional bullet points under them have no specific requirements to avoid softlocks.</li>
<li>Quests are listed by questline/category. The order these quests are listed in does not guarantee that you will be able to get 100% completion by doing them in that order. Make sure to familiarize yourself with the listed softlocks before completing quests.</li>
<li>There are numerous additional bugs that are specific to each quest that have known workarounds. Only true softlocks are listed. Use the hyperlinks for each quest in the 100% Checklist to see a detailed list of bugs and info about each quest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Thieves Guild questline has several cases where a quest can be completed along with a Blood Price for ‚Äúfailing‚Äù it. These situations actually reward two quests completed each. More info is provided in the Thieves Guild section below.</li>
Failing a quest will still count it as complete in most cases. For example, for the Speechcraft Training quest, if you choose to kill a beggar instead of talking to all of them, the stat will still increment in your journal even though you didn‚Äôt do what you were supposed to.
<ul><li>Be careful when doing this, as many quests that can be failed will not reward you Fame, a faction rank, etc. if you fail them.

</div>

<div class="category">
<div class="categoryTitle"><span class="quest">Bruma Gate</span></div>
<ul>
	<li>This quest unlocks the ability to discover the Bruma Gate location and close the gate.

	<ul>
		<li><span class="quest">The Wayward Knight</span> quest is done during the Cheydinhal Oblivion Gate. Simply ignoring <span class="npc">Farwil</span> and closing the gate without interacting with him will avoid him dying so that you don‚Äôt miss the +2 Fame for that quest as well.
