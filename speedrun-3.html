<li>Enter the console commands “sdt 12” and “tdt” before the run starts, and make sure your wait timer is
set to 1 hour. <b>If the game crashes at any point, enter the “sdt 12” and “tdt” console commands again.</b></li>
<li>Move the difficulty slider to the easiest setting (all the way left)</li>
<li>Make your character a Male Redguard.</li>
<li>Time starts as soon as you click "Continue" on the first tutorial box that appears. You are not allowed to move before that happens.</li>

<ol>
<li>Click continue on the quest pop-up to start the run. Press caps lock to always be sprinting, and press F3 to bring up the spell menu.</li>
<li>Hotkey <span class="spellname">Flare</span> and equip <span class="spellname">Adrenaline Rush</span>.</li>
<li>Cast <span class="spellname">Adrenaline Rush</span> and <a href="./glitches.html#saveclip">Save Clip</a> through the right front edge of the NE archway.</li>
<li>When you clip through the wall, run to the east until you spawn back in bounds. This is called <a href="./glitches.html#voidwarp">Void Warping</a>. If the clip doesn’t work, try setting the quicksave up again and loading again.</li>
<li>Jump up into the east archway and Save Clip through the seam between the two walls. Continue to run east after you clip until the black box is off the top of the screen, then wait until you Void Warp.</li>
<li>Take the Chameleon and Flash Bolt scrolls, as well as the lockpicks and Iron Key off the Goblin corpse. Make a save. Make sure to write down the number of the save. It will be referred to as <span class="replaceable" clid="savepermakey">PermaKey_Save</span> later.
<li>Open the door so that the popup shows up about using the Iron Key, and press escape to load the <span class="replaceable" clid="savepermakey">PermaKey_Save</span> you just made. This glitches the game into allowing you to open most doors without needing to pick the lock.
<li>Continue linearly until you get past the square room with eight pillars. Pick up the Tomato, Cheese, and Rusty Iron Shield in the center of these pillars. Then hug the right wall to find a chest just past the next area with the light shafts. Take the Potions of Healing and Weak Potion of Sorcery from it.</li>
<li>Continue linearly to the next area with a goblin. Take the Novice Mortar and Pestle from on top of the broken crate.</li>
<li>Continue to the main large area with several goblins. Take the Repair Hammer and 18 gold from the locked chest by the Goblin Shaman.</li>
<li>Continue until you get to the Imperial Subterrane. Fall down and use <span class="spellname">Flare</span> to kill the Mythic Dawn Agent up on the SW ledge.</li>
<li>Head SE and punch the <span class="npc">Emperor</span> six times to make them chase you. Run back to the door in the main area and yield when <span class="npc">Glenroy</span> is close enough to you.</li>
<li>Kill the Mythic Dawn Agent when the door opens, then wait for the next door to open and kill the other Mythic Dawn Agents that appear.</li>
<li>Run up to the Emperor and wait for him to talk to you.
<div class="dialogue" >
a. Advance predetermined dialogue.
b. Select <b>The Steed</b> as your birthsign.
c. Advance all predetermined dialogue.
</div>
</li>
<li>Talk to <span class="npc">Baurus</span>, who will give you a torch.
<li>Use your hotkey to equip <span class="spellname">Flare</span> again. Hit the Emperor once to get them to chase you, then run ahead and kill any Mythic Dawn Agents on your way. Yield to the Emperor when you are by the door to the next area.</li>
<li>Make sure <span class="npc">Baurus</span> spawns in the next area when you go through the door. If he doesn’t you may need to go back through the door and enter the zone again.</li>
<li>In the next area, hug the right wall and jump to the ledge across the gap. Save Clip facing west through the door. As soon as you clip through, curve around to the left and run SE until you Void Warp.</li>
<li>Head SE down the hall and <span class="spellname">Flare</span> the Mythic Dawn Agent.</li>
<li>Head back and go through the Iron Gate and talk to <span class="npc">Baurus</span>.
<div class="dialogue">
a. Advance predetermined dialogue.
b. Make a custom class with the following:
i. Specialization: Magic
ii. Favored Attributes: Strength and Speed
iii. Major skills: Acrobatics, Alteration, Conjuration, Destruction, Illusion, Mysticism, and
