<li>When you clip through the wall, run to the east until you spawn back in bounds. This is called <span class="glitch" clid="glitchvoidwarp">Void Warping</span>. If the clip doesn’t work, try setting the quicksave up again and loading again.</li>
<li>Jump up into the east archway and Save Clip through the seam between the two walls. Continue to run east after you clip until the black box is off the top of the screen, then wait until you Void Warp.</li>
<li>Take the Chameleon and Flash Bolt scrolls, as well as the lockpicks and Iron Key off the Goblin corpse. Make a save. Make sure to write down the number of the save. It will be referred to as <span class="save" clid="savepermakey">PermaKey_Save</span> later.
<li>Open the door so that the popup shows up about using the Iron Key, and press escape to load the <span class="save" clid="savepermakey" disabled="true">PermaKey_Save</span> you just made. This glitches the game into allowing you to open most doors without needing to pick the lock.

<li>Make sure <span class="npc">Baurus</span> spawns in the next area when you go through the door. If he doesn’t you may need to go back through the door and enter the zone again.</li>
<li>In the next area, hug the right wall and jump to the ledge across the gap. Save Clip facing west through the door. As soon as you clip through, curve around to the left and run SE until you Void Warp.</li>

<ol>
<li>Read <span class="book" clid="book86">Before the Ages of Man [Mysticism]</span> on the altar to your immediate right. </li>
<li>Go outside and head left into the Lustratorium and read <span class="book" clid="book10">Song of the Alchemists [Alchemy]</span> on the bookshelf on the back wall. </li>
<li>Next, exit and start heading to the right towards the farthest door. On the way, go into the Mage’s Quarters and grab the <span class="nirnroot" clid="0x0006F26B">Nirnroot</span> in the side room on the main floor. Leave and continue moving towards the far end of the Arcane University.</li>
</ol>
Once you get to the Praxographical Center, go to the spellmaking altar and create the following spell: <b>The naming conventions of spells will be used throughout the guide.</b>
<br/>
<table>
<tr><th>Spell</th><th>Effects</th></tr>
<tr><td><span class="spellname">D_DisposDrain</span></td><td> Command Humanoid (On Touch, 4 magnitude, 0 area, 1 second)</td></tr></table>
<br/><br/>
<ol>
<li>To farm gold, start by fast traveling to the Imperial City Talos Plaza District. Head SSE and go into Dorian’s House. Equip <span class="spellname">D_DisposDrain</span> and take off any armor if you are wearing it.</li>
<li>Repeat the following sequence 12 times:
<ol><li>Cast <span class="spellname">D_DisposDrain</span> on Dorian.</li>
<li>Bribe Dorian to max disposition (should be around 90).</li></ol></li>
<li>Use the Mage’s Staff of Paralysis on Dorian. Immediately pickpocket him once he is paralyzed to avoid getting a massive bounty. Spam click the gold in his inventory until you have 425,000 gold. You should get about 1,000 gold per click.</li>
<li>Once you are done with that, drop the staff. Go outside and talk to a guard to pay the 40 gold for your fine.</li>
<li>Return to the Arcane University and go to the Chironasium, which is the second farthest right door.</li>
<li>Dupe the filled Grand Soul Gems so that you have 35 to use for enchanting. Dupe the Brass Ring until you have 34 of them.</li>
<li>Drop 48 of your 50 scroll stack so that you have a 2 scroll stack. <b>Drop all Skooma except for one and stop drinking it for now.</b></li>
<li>Do the following sequence:
<ol><li>Enchant the Brass Ring to Fortify Strength 10 points using a filled Grand Soul Gem. Make sure the name of the ring is unique, so name them incrementing numbers as you go.</li>
<li>Dupe the ring using a 2 scroll stack.</li>
<li>Pick up duped rings and equip one copy of it.</li>
<li>Use the 2 scroll stack to dupe again, dropping the copy that is not equipped.</li>
<li>You now have a permanent +10 Strength glitched onto your character.</li></ol></li>
<li>Repeat this process a total of 5 times for a +50 Strength bonus (85 total). Repeat again for the remaining 29 rings selecting Speed instead of Strength to get +290 Speed (355 total). Make sure to keep 1 Filled Grand Soul Gem, and pick up the 48 scrolls you dropped.</li>
<li>Head back to the Praxographical Center (the last door at the far end).</li>
</ol>
Make the following six spells, with these exact names, as they will be referenced later.<br/>
<b>The order of the effects needs to be exactly as listed in order for the spells to farm the right skill:</b><br/>
<table>
<tr><th>Spell</th><th>Effects</th></tr>
<tr><td><span class="spellname">A_Alt</span></td><td>Shield (On Touch, 3%, 1 second)<br/>Fortify Magicka (Self, 21 points, 2 seconds)</td></tr>

Now that you can get your Mercantile to 75+ with a spell, you can go around investing in every shop owner in the game. It is best to do this early since some quests interfere with your ability to invest and merchants can randomly die and ruin the run.
<br/>
<p><b>You should now start farming Acrobatics constantly for the rest of the run.</b> Unfortunately, you cannot spam your farming spells during this part since the investing spell requires magicka.</p>
Do the following additional tasks at various peoples’ stores/homes:
<ul><li>Follow the red line on each map to each numbered location and do the tasks listed.</li>
	<li>Whenever instructed to <b>Invest</b>, cast the <span class="spellname">B_Mercantile </span>spell and immediately talk to the NPC, then select the “Invest 500 gold in this shop” dialogue option.</li>
	<li>Whenever instructed to start a training quest, cast the <span class="spellname">B_[Skill]</span> spell and immediately talk to the NPC, then select the “Training” dialogue option.</li>

<p>Farm Acrobatics and your hotkeyed A_[Skill] spells everywhere you go while blocking with your weapon to speed up the casting animation, but make sure not to level up skills too far. Reading skill books for a maxed out skill will not count, and ruin the run.

<p><b>Warning: The Destruction and Conjuration farming spells will make NPCs hostile if they are touched with the spell, so avoid doing this.</b></p>
<p><b>General tip about questing:</b> If you are ever unable to fast travel after exiting a dungeon, try quicksaving and quickloading while outdoors, which can despawn enemies that were aggro inside the dungeon. This is called the QSQL De-Aggro glitch.</p>

<div class="sectionTitle">Thieves Guild</div>
<div class="collapsibleContent">
The Thieves Guild has Blood Prices for murdering people while doing a job. Paying the Blood Price for each quest not only increments the quests completed stat an additional time per quest, but some quests finish early without actually having to finish the job upon paying the Blood Price. All 9 Blood Prices are required to get the highest Quests Completed stat possible.
<p>You will need to use the Yield Glitch at a few points during this part of the run, so read the below instructions to make sure you know how to do that.</p>
How to do the Yield Glitch:
<ol>
	<li>Drag hostile guards towards a doorway to an outdoor area.</li>
	<li>Yield by holding block while trying to talk to a guard. You need to be spaced far enough away that the guard will not immediately enter dialogue with you. Alternatively, if they get staggered by block knockback, the window of timing will be much easier.</li>
	<li>Immediately exit the area before the guard can talk to you. Do not re-enter the area before fast traveling away to clear your bounty.</li>
	<li>Alternatively, yielding and opening your inventory on the same frame will allow you to fast travel away if you are outdoors. This is referred to as the Instant Yield Glitch.</li>

Several skill books can only be found through random loot. You should already have a few of these due to some quests rewarding a random loot book, so double check which ones you have before you start this part. They are bolded on the checklist.
Fast travel to the describedlocations around the map, drink 8 Skooma by drinking 4 from your hotkey and 4 from your menu while facing the entrance to the location, quicksave before entering the dungeon, then loot the described chests. If no new skill books are found, quickload and enter the dungeon again.
<p>Random loot chests respawn every 73 hours, so loot each of the three dungeons successfully by saving and reloading, wait outside for 73 hours, and then repeat until you have located all of the books. You have a 10% chance of finding a skill book, so this process can take awhile. Make sure you read each skill book when you find it.</p>
